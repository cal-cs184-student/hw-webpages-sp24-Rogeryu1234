        <p>
            In this homework, we implemented a system for cloth simulation using point masses connected by
            different types of springs. We integrated functionality to let the cloth react to external and internal
            forces by exerting a force value onto each point mass and using Verlet integration to calculate their next
            positions. We explored cloth collision by implementing collision detection for sphere and plane geometries,
            as well as self-collision so that the cloth can correctly fall onto itself without clipping. We also implemented
            a variety of shaders, working with GLSL!

        <h2 align="middle">Part 1: Masses and springs</h2>
    </a>

    <p>
        To build the grid of springs and masses, we implemented it in 2 phases. During the first phase, we
        created the point masses by calculating the positions for each and determined whether each one is pinned.
        The point masses are distributed uniformly across the specified dimensions. If the cloth is oriented
        horizontally, we distribute the point masses over the xz plane and give a y position of 1 for each. If
        the cloth is oriented vertically, we distribute the point masses over the xy plane and generate small
        random offsets between -1/1000 and 1/1000 for the z position for each point mass. In the next phase, we add
        in the springs. We iterate over each point mass that was generated and calculated their positions relative
        to the top left point mass (at position 0,0). Depending on these positions, we create a structural, shearing,
        and/or bending spring connecting the current point mass to its top/left/diagonally top-left/diagonally top-right
        point mass.

        Changing the spring constant ks alters the rigidity of the cloth. When ks is very low, the cloth appears
        to be much more fluid when it dangles down from start to rest and falls much faster. When ks is very high, the cloth appears
        to be much more stiff and "sticky" when it falls. In fact, it does not fall all the way down since the springs
        are holding the point masses tightly together.

        Changing the density affects the mass of the cloth. We observe that when density is low, the cloth does
        not drop down by much which can be seen from the amount of curvature of the center arc formed from the 2
        pinned corners. When the density is high, we observe a much greater curvature between the 2 pinned corners
        because the cloth has a high mass and thus drapes down more.

        Changing the damping percentage affects how fast the cloth moves as it falls down and how long it eventually
        arrives at the rest positoin. Having a lower damping value allows the cloth to move with lower resistance, hence
        facilitating faster movement and prolonging the duration until rest. Having a higher damping value means more resistance
        to cloth movement, which in turn slows down its fall but allows it to arrive at rest position faster.

        <h2 align="middle">Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
    </a>

    <p>
        To implement collisions with spheres and planes, we implemented respective algorithms in each geometry
        that takes in a point mass object and calculates its corrected offset position from the geometry if it
        intersects with the geometry. For a sphere, we calculated the distance between a point mass and the origin
        of sphere and compared it with the sphere's radius to determine if this point intersects with the sphere.
        If it does, then we calculate a correction vector then translates the last position of this point mass to
        a tangent point on the sphere. We finally scale this correction vector by the friction value and update the
        current position of this point mass. For a plane, we first determine if a point mass is on or "inside" the plane
        by taking the dot product between the plane's normal vector and the direction from
        a point on the plane to point mass' position. If it is, then we calculate the tangent point on the plane where the intersection happens,
        and calculate a correction vector that accounts for a small surface offset from the tangent point. Finally,
        we account for the friction when updating the position of point mass with correction vector. In cloth.cpp's
        simulate() function, we execute collision handling logic after Verlet integration of each point mass.

        We know that the spring constant determines the rigidity of the cloth. We can observe here that as ks
        increases from 500 N/m to 50000 N/m, the cloth wraps less and less tightly around the sphere. This is
        because stiffer cloth generally is less capable of altering its shape, which is reflected by these screenshots.

        When we vary the density, it affects how quickly the cloth falls and how creased the cloth appears at
        rest state. The higher the density, the heavier the cloth is and thus the faster it will fall onto itself.
        Since the cloth is heavier, it weighs onto itself more and folds more tightly, which increases the number
        of creases the cloth has at rest state. When we vary the spring constant, it affects how easily the cloth 
        folds on itself because it affects how rigid the cloth is. When the spring constant is low, the cloth is
        less rigid and thus can fold onto itself more easily, creating more folds and creases. When the spring constant
        is high, the cloth is more rigid and thus fold onto itself less easily and create less folds and creases.

        A shader program is a set of instructions written in a specialized language (such as GLSL in the case of OpenGL) that runs on the GPU. It consists of two main types of shaders: vertex shaders and fragment shaders.
        <br>
Vertex shaders primarily manipulate the geometric properties of vertices, such as position and normal vectors. They take input attributes like vertex position and normal, perform transformations (e.g., model to world space), and output data (such as transformed position and normal) to be used by fragment shaders.
        <br>
Fragment shaders, on the other hand, operate on fragments, which are essentially pixels on the screen. They receive interpolated values from the vertex shader (such as interpolated normal vectors), calculate the final color of each fragment, and output it. Fragment shaders are responsible for applying lighting models, textures, and other material properties.
    </p>

            Explain the Blinn-Phong shading model in your own words.
            Show a screenshot of your Blinn-Phong shader outputting only the ambient component, a screen shot only outputting the diffuse component, a screen shot only outputting the specular component, and one using the entire Blinn-Phong model.

    </blockquote>

    <p>
        The Blinn-Phong shading model is a widely used lighting model in computer graphics. It combines ambient, diffuse, and specular components to calculate the final color of a surface point.
<br>
Ambient component represents the constant background light that illuminates all surfaces equally.
\[\mathbf{L}_a = \mathbf{k}_a \mathbf{I}_a\]
Diffuse component simulates the light scattered equally in all directions by a rough surface.
\[\mathbf{L}_d = \mathbf{k}_d (\mathbf{I}/r^2) \max(0, \mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{l})\]
Specular component represents the highlights produced by light reflecting off a shiny surface.
\[\mathbf{L}_s = \mathbf{k}_s (\mathbf{I}/r^2) \max(0, \mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{h})^p\]

    We use the parameters 
    \[k_a = 0.02; \quad k_d = 1; \quad k_s = 0.5; \quad p=40\]
    We can see that for the Ambient component only it is almost purely black, since we use a very small ambient light source.
    <br>
    for the diffuse component only plot, it is diffuse reflecting.
    <br>
    for the specular component, it is shiny.

    I use the perseids meteor shower 2023 as the texture, and it looks beautiful, isn't it?

        We use texture_4.png for all the rendering. Comparing them, we can see the differences. Bump mapping changes the surface normals but the Displacement mapping changes 
        the vertices' positions. We can see that the displacement mapping is more dramatic and more visible, we can see that the the displacement mapping's rendering has more curvatures compared with the bumping mapping.
        <br>
        <br>
        The Bump mapping is almost not affected by the change, we cannot see any significant changes, but the displacement mapping is affected a lot when we changed the sphere's coarseness.
        This makes sense, since when the coarseness increases, the normal changes and therefore the vertices moves more in displacement mapping. On the other side, the Bump mapping also changes, but it doens't change a lot, since only the matrix TBN changes.
